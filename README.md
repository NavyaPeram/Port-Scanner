# Port-Scanner
This Python script provides a comprehensive security assessment toolkit for web applications and networks. It evaluates website accessibility, checks critical security headers, and analyzes SSL/TLS configurations, including protocol versions, cipher suites, and certificate details. Additionally, it tests for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) using predefined payloads and performs multithreaded port scanning to identify open ports on the target website. Built with libraries such as requests, ssl, socket, and cryptography, this script offers a versatile and extensible solution for basic security testing and analysis.
